			<p><b>Want to add a Madlibs to the API?</b></p>
			<p>Edit this JSON file here: <a href="https://github.com/HermanFassett/madlibz/blob/master/data/templates.json">https://github.com/HermanFassett/madlibz/blob/master/data/templates.json</a></p>
			<p>The format of the file is as follows:</p>
			<pre>{
    "templates": [...]
}</pre>
			<p>To add your own Madlibs to the file, you need to put it in the "templates" array in the following format:</p>
			<pre>
{
    "title": "Your Madlibs Title",
    "blanks": ["name", "verb ending in 'ing'"],
    "value": ["Hello ", " what are you ", " ?", 0]
}</pre>
		<p>Where <b>title</b> is the name of your Madlibs, <b>blanks</b> contains <b>in order</b> the input types the user will need to do, and <b>value</b> contains the actual text of the Madlibs, split as an array
		wherever a blank is, and ending with a 0 (non string). Don't forget to include the spaces in these values. The 0 is there mostly for the one word example of Hello _____ noun. It shouldn't matter where in the
		json file you put your Madlibs, but please do put it at the end, and make sure, in proper json style, that the previous sample has a comma after it!!!</p>
